## Knowledge-Graph
Knowledge graphs are becoming increasingly important in a variety of fields, including artificial intelligence and information science. They are a graphical representation of entities and the relationships between them, allowing for more efficient and effective storage, analysis, and use of information.

In AI, knowledge graphs provide a structured way to represent vast amounts of information and make it easily accessible for use in machine learning tasks such as question answering, recommendation systems, and information retrieval. They also allow for easier integration of data from multiple sources, reducing the time and effort needed to clean and process data.

In the healthcare and life sciences fields, knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in drug discovery and personalized medicine by providing a comprehensive view of biological entities, pathways, and relationships between diseases and treatments.

In general, knowledge graphs offer a unified representation of information, making it easier for people and machines to access and make use of knowledge. As the amount of data continues to grow, the importance of knowledge graphs is only set to increase in the future.

This tutorial will help you generate a knowledge graph from some structured datasets such as CSV, JSON and XML. We will use Semantic Web technologies to build our knowledge graph. If you are not familiar with Semantic Web technologies, we provide you with some basic concepts and technologies about Semantic Web based Knowledge Graphs.[link](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/best-practices/blog/2021/03/18/build-a-kg/)

The rapid accumulation of biomedical data and the growing popularity of knowledge graphs as a means of representing complex information have led to the development of the BioCypher framework (https://biocypher.org). This tool aims to assist research groups in building their own biomedical knowledge graphs, which can be cost-prohibitive otherwise

  A*Net is a scalable path-based method for knowledge graph reasoning. Inspired by the classical A* algorithm, A*Net learns a neural priority function to select important nodes and edges at each iteration, which significantly reduces time and memory footprint for both training and inference.[https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/AStarNet](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/AStarNet)
